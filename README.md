# Auto-Plus-Insurance-Visualization-Dashboard-
This shows the excel sheet for an AutoPlus Insurance company. I created a simple visualization  Dashboard to generate insights from the data provided. 
I used pivot tables, pivot charts, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, and Index Match, for the visualization and this project resulted to a 20% improved user satisfaction rating.
